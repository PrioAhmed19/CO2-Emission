# CO2-Emission
The "CO2 Emissions Prediction Challenge" aims to address the critical issue of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their impact on the environment. Participants will be provided with a comprehensive dataset featuring various indicators such as access to electricity, agricultural land, energy consumption, population growth, GDP per capita, and more across multiple countries. The dataset spans from 2000 to 2020 and includes key environmental and socio-economic factors that influence CO2 emissions. The challenge revolves around predicting CO2 emissions per capita for the year 2030, a pivotal milestone for climate action and sustainability efforts worldwide.
