# CO2-Emission
The "CO2 Emissions Prediction Challenge" aims to address the critical issue of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their impact on the environment. Participants will be provided with a comprehensive dataset featuring various indicators such as access to electricity, agricultural land, energy consumption, population growth, GDP per capita, and more across multiple countries. The dataset spans from 2000 to 2020 and includes key environmental and socio-economic factors that influence CO2 emissions. The challenge revolves around predicting CO2 emissions per capita for the year 2030, a pivotal milestone for climate action and sustainability efforts worldwide.

Participants are tasked with leveraging machine learning techniques and predictive modeling to accurately forecast CO2 emissions per capita based on the provided indicators. This competition offers an opportunity for data scientists, researchers, and environmental enthusiasts to contribute towards understanding and mitigating the impacts of climate change. By developing innovative models and insights, participants can aid policymakers, businesses, and communities in making informed decisions and implementing effective strategies to reduce CO2 emissions and promote environmental sustainability.

Goal: In this Kaggle competition - which is a part of the #MLOlympiad the goal is to develop predictive models that forecast CO2 emissions per capita for the year 2030 with high accuracy. Participants will leverage the provided dataset containing diverse socio-economic and environmental indicators to train and test their models. By accurately predicting future CO2 emissions, participants can contribute valuable insights to address global climate challenges and inform policy decisions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The competition encourages collaboration, innovation, and data-driven solutions to promote environmental sustainability and combat climate change on a global scale.
